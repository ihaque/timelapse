Repo for timelapse creation scripts

linearize_frames.py: takes three arguments. source directory containing all
                     source images (potentially in subdirectories), target
                     directory, and name for output log file. Finds all JPEG
                     files in source directory, sorts by DateTimeDigitized in
                     EXIF, symlinks to target directory in format
                     frame.XXXX.jpg, and writes out log file with output
                     filenames and EXIF time.
